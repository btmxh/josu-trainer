# josu-trainer
A Java rewrite of FunOrange's osu-trainer, with minimal dependencies

The reason that I made this is because osu-trainer crashes every time when I launched it on my system. I've checked the code and tried to rebuild the program in Visual Studio but I had some issues. I also want to try some osu! related programming.
(This is why if you have no problems with osu-trainer, there should be no reasons to use this app, maybe I'll add more features in the future)

This also included a interop module for [gosu-memory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory) to find the current playing map.
